- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Git

### Quick Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HopfieldAssigmentProblemSolver.git
   cd HopfieldAssigmentProblemSolver
   ```
3. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
4. Start development services:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Modify `.env` for your development needs:
   ```bash
   ENV=development
   GIN_MODE=debug
   LOG_LEVEL=debug
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies
make install-deps

# Or install individually:
# Python dependencies
cd hopfield && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Go dependencies
cd api && go mod download
```

### Running Services Locally

```bash
# Run Hopfield service
make dev-python

# Run API Gateway (in another terminal)
make dev-go

# Or run both with Docker
make dev
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/RobertoDeLaCamara/HopfieldAssigmentProblemSolver/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Write clear, focused commits
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Follow the coding standards

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests locally
make test-local

# Test API functionality
make test-api
```

### 5. Update Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Update API documentation in `docs/API.md`
- Add code comments for complex logic

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage

The project maintains comprehensive test coverage with:
- **74 Python unit tests** (`hopfield/tests/`) + **23 Go unit tests** (`api/`) for individual components and algorithms
- **13 integration tests** for end-to-end functionality
- **100% test pass rate** across all test suites

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in Docker (recommended)
make test

# Run unit tests only
make test-unit

# Run integration tests only
make test-integration

# Run tests with coverage report
make test-coverage

# Run tests locally (without Docker)
make test-local

# Test API functionality manually
make test-api
```

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests** (`hopfield/tests/`): Test Hopfield algorithm, API validation, error handling
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration_test.py`): Test service communication, performance, batch processing
- **API Tests**: Test REST endpoints, health checks, error responses

### Writing Tests

#### Python Tests (Hopfield Service)

- Place test files in `hopfield/tests/`
- Use `pytest` framework
- Follow naming convention: `test_*.py`

```python
import pytest
from src.hopfield_solver import HopfieldAssignmentSolver

def test_solver_initialization():
    solver = HopfieldAssignmentSolver()
    assert solver is not None

def test_solve_simple_problem():
    solver = HopfieldAssignmentSolver()
    cost_matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    assignments, cost, iterations = solver.solve(cost_matrix)
    assert len(assignments) == 2
    assert cost >= 0
    assert iterations > 0
```

#### Go Tests (API Gateway)

- Place test files alongside source code with `_test.go` suffix
- Use Go's built-in testing framework

```go
package handlers

import (
    "testing"
    "net/http/httptest"
)

func TestHealthCheck(t *testing.T) {
    req := httptest.NewRequest("GET", "/health", nil)
    w := httptest.NewRecorder()

    HealthCheck(w, req)

    if w.Code != 200 {
        t.Errorf("Expected status 200, got %d", w.Code)
    }
}
```

### Test Coverage

Aim for high test coverage, especially for:
- Core algorithm logic
- API endpoints
- Error handling
- Edge cases

## 💅 Code Style

### Python (Hopfield Service)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use `black` for code formatting
- Use `flake8` for linting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Lint code
make lint
```

### Go (API Gateway)

- Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- Use `golangci-lint` for linting
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names

```bash
# Format Go code
cd api && go fmt ./...

# Lint Go code
cd api && golangci-lint run
```

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex algorithms
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors appropriately

## 📝 Submitting Changes

### Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add rate limiting middleware"
git commit -m "Fix division by zero in cost calculation (#123)"
git commit -m "Update API documentation with new endpoints"
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. **Run tests and linting**:
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   make format
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Provide detailed description of changes
   - Reference related issues
   - Add screenshots for UI changes

4. **Code Review**:
   - Address review comments
   - Make requested changes
   - Ensure CI checks pass

5. **Merge**:
   - Squash commits if requested
   - Delete branch after merge
